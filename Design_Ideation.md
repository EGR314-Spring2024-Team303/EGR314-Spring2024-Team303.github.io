# Design Ideation

### Generated Ideas

#### The Process
The process of generating ideas consisted of an in-person meeting with all of the group members. We created a group Jam Board where each sticky note denotes one idea. This needed to be done in person to ensure that generated ideas were not duplicated throughout the brainstorming process. Each team member added to this brainstorming session individually for the first 50-60 features until our team became stuck. We then reconvened as a team to further extrapolate from these ideas to find overarching themes that held great significance to our project. During the more collaborative portion of this project, our team fostered a welcoming space for all ideas both far-reaching and earthbound. After generating 100 individual ideas we were able to rank these into 3 different color-coded categories listed below.

* ðŸŸ© Embedded Systems: Anything related to the PCB (Sockets, EMF, Fuse Overcharge, Sensors)
* ðŸŸ¦ Hardware: Physical components to support the PCB (Wheels, 3D print items, Frames) 
* ðŸŸ§ Software: Anything that will be digital to support the PCB (AI, Voice Recognition, Code)

### Concepts
#### Concept 1

##### Description:
The first sketch is a rough idea of a mobile weather station. This is inspired by the Dr. Robot Jaguar 4x4. This design will help the mobile weather station if it is flipped upside down the vehicle can still operate upside down and keep moving without much issue.
#### Concept 2
![Concept 2 Iso](https://github.com/EGR314-Spring2024-Team303/EGR314-Spring2024-Team303.github.io/assets/39510849/92a647dd-9664-4cf1-a2a5-1bbe4c46a54e)
##### Description: 
The second sketch represents a 2-wheeler RC with a PCB socket and another component integrated into it like headlights and sensors. The maneuver will be driven with one motor and the steering came from a difference in the speed of the wheels. Wall-E inspires this design.
#### Concept 3
