TC74A4-3.3VCTTR Surface Mount Temperature Sensor

Our team chose The TC74A4-3.3VCTTR because of the significant price difference and the easy interface with the microcontroller. Since the components are I2C, it is easier to implement with a wide range of microcontrollers. 
It's tiny in size so it won't interfere with other components on a PCB. Moreover, it's already provided in class so it's cost-effective.
