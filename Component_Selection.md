* IFX9201SGAUMA1-6A H bridge with SPI Motor Driver

Our team picked IFX9201SG. This particular surface mount H-bridge model has an SPI interface which our team had already experienced in one of the ICC. 
So, our team is confident to work around this component. Moreover, the range of operating voltage of the component is 3.3V - 5.0V. 

## Temperature Sensors

* TC74A4-3.3VCTTR Surface Mount Temperature Sensor

Our team chose The TC74. Since the components are I2C, it is easier to implement with a wide range of microcontrollers. It's tiny in size so it won't interfere with other components on 
a PCB. Moreover, it's already provided in class so it's cost-effective, and our team would be more familiar with working around it. 

# Barometric Sensors

 * SM9543-005M-D-C-3-S TE Connectivity / SMI Mouser Surface mount Barometric sensor
      
Our team chose SM9543. This model of the barometric pressure sensor compared to other models is bulkier than other models but at the same time compact enough to fit in a small project. 
It's easy to solder and operate with I2C Interface. 

## Motor

   * DC3V-12V DC Geared Motor

Of all the models, we found this model is a good fit for our project. This motor model provides a good amount of RPM and it also operates from 3V to 12V
which is also a good fit for the integration into our project. On top of that, it's cost-effective.
  
## Battery

* ICR18650 2200mAh 3.7V

This battery has a higher discharge rate. On top of that, the energy density will make sure that the motors and the PCB can run for a longer period.
It also makes it easier with the outer shell being more protected this is very important as we do not want our batteries becoming puffy and exploding when they are potentially     
penetrated.
