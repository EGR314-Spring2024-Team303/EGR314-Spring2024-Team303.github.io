# 10 Lessons Learned

## Interdisciplinary Collaboration

The project emphasized the importance of collaboration between engineers from different disciplines like electrical and robotics engineers with electrical focuses to create a holistic solution.

## Real-World Constraints Awareness

Understanding real-world constraints such as power consumption, size, and weight limitations is crucial in designing practical embedded systems.

## Environmental Considerations

Developing a weather station meant being mindful of environmental factors like temperature, atmospheric pressure, and ruggedness to ensure reliable operation in various conditions.

## Sensor Integration Challenges

Integrating diverse sensors (e.g., temperature and pressure) required careful consideration of data acquisition, calibration, and synchronization.

## Data Processing Optimization

Efficient algorithms and data processing techniques were essential for extracting meaningful insights from raw sensor data.

## Communication Protocols

Implementing robust communication protocols (e.g., Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) was vital for seamless data transmission between the weather station and external devices.

## Power Management Strategies

Developing effective power management strategies, including a fuse and low-power components, was critical for extending the device's battery life.

## User Interface Design

Designing an intuitive user interface for configuring settings, displaying data, and providing feedback enhanced the usability and user experience of the weather station.

## Testing and Validation

Rigorous testing and validation procedures, including environmental testing and field trials, were necessary to ensure the system's reliability and accuracy.

## Documentation and Maintenance

Comprehensive documentation and ongoing maintenance plans facilitated future enhancements, troubleshooting, and scalability of the embedded system.
