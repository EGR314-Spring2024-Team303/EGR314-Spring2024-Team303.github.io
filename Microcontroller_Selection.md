  Our team chose a microcontroller model PIC18F27Q10. This microcontroller model has 25 General Purposes Input/Output pins with 2 I2C pins 2 SPI pins, and 2 PWM pins. Moreover, the operating voltage ranges from 1.8V to 5.5V
  which respond to our operating range perfectly. This microcontroller also has 3000 bytes of RAM which can hold many lines of code. Not only, does it come in a DIP package but it is also a SOIC package.
  More information about our choice-making can be referred to in [Appendix C](Appendix_C.md)
