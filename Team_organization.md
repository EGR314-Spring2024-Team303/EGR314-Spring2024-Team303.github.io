# Team Organization

## Our Goal 

As an aspiring engineering student, we are dedicated to developing proficient embedded system design skills for future projects. Our commitment lies in the seamless integration of subsystems and promptly resolving any debugging challenges that may arise. Furthermore, our team possesses the capability to identify and address challenges in both the design and construction phases of our subsystems.
Recognizing the significance of collaboration, we excel in sharing ideas, resolving differences, and ensuring flawless, safe, and user-friendly development of our products. Our empathetic and collaborative approach ensures effective teamwork, allowing us to achieve our shared objectives with professionalism and efficiency collectively.

## Mission Statement 
Empowering individuals with real-time weather insights anytime, anywhere, our mobile weather station delivers accurate forecasts and crucial data to enhance safety, decision-making, and enjoyment of the outdoors.

## Communication Channels
Our team communication channels mainly consist of ASU email and Discord. Our contact information as well as our roles and meeting schedule can be found in [Appendix A](Appendix_A.md)

## Communication Procedures
The team will primarily use Discord for ongoing discussions and employ in-person meetings, Snapchat Group messages, and weekly meetings for synchronous communication. Urgent matters will be addressed through phone calls. Responsibility for relaying announcements from classes falls on attendees, who will use Snapchat for those unable to attend. Team members will maintain direct contact with the professor, and the team recorder will serve as the main liaison for effective communication. This streamlined strategy aims to enhance collaboration and efficiency throughout the project.
